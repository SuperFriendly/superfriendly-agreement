        <h2>Project Details, Terms, and Conditions between [Client Name] &amp; SuperFriendly Co.</h2>

        <time>Monday, December 8, 2014</time>

        <p>Hi [Client&rsquo;s First Name]!
        <p>We&rsquo;re happy that You&rsquo;ve chosen to work with Us, and We look forward to a lasting relationship! This is our Service Agreement (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;). It begins as of [Month] [Day], 2014, and is made between SuperFriendly Co. (&ldquo;Us&rdquo;)and [Client Name] (&ldquo;You&rdquo;).</p>
  
        <p>In short, <strong>We will build a website for You with the goal of [Goal]. We will work and collaborate with you to the best of our ability to complete it by [end date]. In total, that will cost $[Fee].</strong></p>

        <p>For details, read on!</p>

                    <h1>A little background</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The purpose of this Agreement is to iron out all the details of our relationship.  We recognize that even though each party is working as hard as possible, questions sometimes arise, and this Agreement is meant to address as much about our relationship as possible.</li>
                        <li>You are hiring Us as experts to complete work for You, the specifics of which will be explained over the following pages. We&rsquo;ll do our best to make this Agreement simple to understand by steering clear of legal jargon, so we&rsquo;ve tried to eliminate it as much as possible. The biggest exception is the next paragraph, which our lawyer insists We keep. Brace yourself:</li>
                        <li>The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:</li>
                        <li>(That wasn&rsquo;t so bad, was it?)</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Project summary.</strong> You are hiring Us to [insert project summary].  Once the project is completed, here&rsquo;s a list of what You can expect Us to deliver (the &ldquo;Deliverables&rdquo;):
                            <ul>
                                <li>Item 1</li>
                                <li>Item 2</li>
                                <li>Item 3</li>
                                <li>Item 4</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Project exclusions.</strong> This project does not include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Item 1</li>
                                <li>Item 2</li>
                                <li>Item 3</li>
                                <li>Item 4</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Change process for deliverables.</strong> Because the project is just getting started, it&rsquo;s important to remember that the Deliverables may change once We begin brainstorming.  If it becomes necessary to change the Deliverables, we can discuss the changes and both parties will sign an addendum to this Agreement, memorializing the changes we&rsquo;ve agreed on.</li>
                        <li><strong>Requirements.</strong> Throughout the project, it&rsquo;s important that You maintain communication with Us.  The project will be divided into phases, and each phase will require certain things from both parties.  The phases will be listed below, but for now, it&rsquo;s important to know that We are agreeing to provide everything We are supposed to according to this Agreement to complete each phase, and that You are also promising to provide everything You are supposed to according to this Agreement to complete each phase, including, but not limited to, feedback, copy, custom photography and other content related aspects of the project.  If either party does not provide what is required of them for each phase in a timely manner, the other party can consider it a breach of this Agreement.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Change process for phases.</strong> Again, because the project is just getting started, the dates and content of each phase are subject to change. If it becomes necessary to change any phase, including dates, We will notify you in writing of the change. Additionally, if after the project begins You decide You want Us to do more work than is accounted for in these phases, together we can agree to add phases. Of course, You agree that, with the addition of phases, We may, after approval by You, raise the Fee.</li>
                        <li><strong>Percentage assignment.</strong> Each phase is assigned a percentage denoting approximately how much of the project that phase represents.  Once We submit everything that is required of Us for a particular phase, that phase is considered complete. In the event the project does not go to completion, You agree to pay Us an amount of the total Fee that is proportionate to the percentage of the project We have completed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feedback process.</strong> Throughout Our completion of phases, We will be seeking Your feedback.  You agree to make yourself available to provide feedback. Although We are going to work very hard to make sure You are completely satisfied, You agree that Your approval is not needed for the purposes of considering a phase completed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Term.</strong> This project will be considered completed upon the completion of all phases listed above, and delivery of the Deliverables, or ends on January 1, 2014, whichever occurs first. Anything outside these deliverables and phases list or after January 1, 2014 will be considered out of scope.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pauses.</strong> You may, at Your option, choose to have Us temporarily halt work on the project (&ldquo;Pause&rdquo;).  If You elect to Pause, You must inform Us in writing of Your decision as well as the projected length of time for the Pause.  We cannot guarantee that We will be able to resume work on Your project immediately following a Pause, but together both parties will agree on a date to resume the project.  Because We have arranged Our schedule to devote a specific time period to Your project, if over the course of the project the amount of time Your requested Pauses last totals more than 30 days We may charge You, and You agree to pay, an amount equal to 5% of the Fee.  If the total amount of time for all Pauses lasts more than sixty days, We may consider that Your notice of Your intention to terminate this Agreement, and the provisions of the article headed &ldquo;Termination&rdquo; will apply, including the addition of a 10% termination fee to the total sum You owe.</li>
                        <li>Both parties agree that if a Pause lasts longer than two weeks, We may need to rescope the project, including changing the completion date for the project and dates phases are due.</li>

                        <li><strong>Notice.</strong> First of all, both parties agree to reasonably try to work things out so that the project is salvageable.  If things can&rsquo;t be worked out, either party can terminate this Agreement by giving the other party 10 days notice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Handoff.</strong> Upon termination, We agree to deliver to You any completed Deliverables, along with notes and any files We have pertaining to the project.  Upon termination You agree to pay Us the portion of the Fee that is due according to what percentage of the project we have completed (determined by adding the percentage assigned to each completed phase).  If We are in the middle of a phase when this Agreement terminates, that phase will be considered half completed.  Because We have reserved a certain block of time to complete this project for You, if You terminate the project before it is completed, We may charge You an additional sum equal to 10% of the Fee.</li>
